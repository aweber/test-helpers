Base Test Cases
===============

The base test cases module contains useful classes that inherit from the
unit test standard library and optionally inherit from an arbitrary number of
mixins.  The purpose of these classes is to provide an integration point for
the mixins and to help promote the usage of the Arrange-Act-Assert testing
methodology used here at AWeber.
